# Manga Cleaner Flask App
This project involved converting Varun Ramachandran's Manga Cleaner service into a web application. Flask was used as the web framework. Varun's service can be found with the following link:
https://github.com/R-Varun/MangaCleaner2.0

In order to run this locally, use the following tutorial to run a Virtual Environment(venv) and install flask on it from the console.

Then run the following lines in the venv:
export FLASK_APP=MangaCleanerFlaskApp
flask run

Going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ should bring you to the webpage.

In order to deactivate the venv, run the following on the console:
deactivate
